Node js:

node js makes possible to work with javascript in server side.
- its runtime environment
- javascripts in server or backend
- without node js, javascript can not work in server
- faster than others php, java (only web)

Framework: library of structured code
express is a node js Framework
- framework makes ur code smarter and small
- structured 
- included a lot of other libraries

What we need to learn about framework? e.g express
SERVER:
how backend javascript code can start and run (software server)
- include express or anything or module ( using require() method )
  require('express'); // framework or library
  require('./models/user') // include module or any js file you created
- app.listen();

Router has routes/path/pages/where to go
www.facebook.com that will go localhost:3000/
www.facebook.com/login that will go localhost:3000/login
app.get('/login');

-**** all routes must have request, response  attributes 
- shortcut res-response, req-request
- inside routes you need header  for response 
     res.send()
     res.sendFile()
     res.render()
     res.json() // when u have no views or design
- when no routes go to home by ('*')
